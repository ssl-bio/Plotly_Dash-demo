general	rep_gene	"<h4>Is representative:</h4> <p> Indicates if the peak was found in a region that matches the <i>representative gene form</i>  defined as, <i>""the model that codes for the longest CDS at each locus‚Äù</i>  </p>"
general	strand	<h4>Strand:</h4><p> Indicates whether the transcript was found in the positive or negative strand </p>
general	shared	<h4>Shared (PyDegradome):</h4> <p> Indicates if the peak region was found on both replicates or only in one of them. The criteria to define a peak as shared was that at they would overlap by at least one nucleotide. </p>
general	category_1	"<h4>Classification 1:</h4> <p> Represents the first classification (and filtering) of the peaks. Four categories were defined based on the magnitude of the ratio between the max read in the peak region and the highest read outside the peak region, all along the transcript. Those peaks that could not be classified by one of the criteria below were labeled as <i>category 0</i> and excluded for further analysis. Also note that category 4 was included as a conservative measure to avoid discarding peaks that were found in one replicate but have a considerable accumulation of reads in the same region of the other replicate. </p> <ul class=""org-ul""> <li><b>Category 1:</b> The peak was identified in both replicates and represents the highest signal on the transcript.</li> <li><b>Category 2:</b> The peak was identified in both replicates and it is at least 80% as high as the highest signal</li> <li><b>Category 3:</b> The peak was identified in both replicates and it is at least 70% as high as the highest signal</li> <li><b>Category 4:</b> The peak was identified in only one replicate and it is at least 80% as high as the highest signal on the transcript. Also, the signals found on the same coordinates for the other replicate are also at least 80\% as high as the highest signal on the transcript.</li> </ul>"
general	category_2	"<h4>Classification 2:</h4> <p> Represents the second classification of the peaks focused on combining the information of both replicates into a single summary measure, <i>mean of normalized counts</i>. Counts per millon (<i>cpm</i>) were calculated for the highest read found in the peak region of test samples and compared to the mean of the highest read found along the whole transcript in the corresponding control samples. Three categories were defined, the first contained those whose ratio was higher than 1 whereas, the second category comprised those peaks whose ratio was higher than the sample median but only for those transcripts that had more than one significant peak. Peaks that could not be classified in either of the two categories were set into a third one so they could be kept for further analysis. </p> <ul class=""org-ul""> <li><b>Category A:</b> Ratio between the mean value of a  peak found in test samples and the \emph{mean} of the highest read found in control samples is higher than one.</li> <li><b>Category B:</b> Only for test samples with more than one peak. Ratio between the mean value of a peak found in test samples and the median of all reads found in control samples is higher than one.</li> <li><b>Category C:</b> Peaks that could not be classified in either category A nor B.</li> </ul>"
general	MorePeaks	<h4>Peaks 2> :</h4> <p> Indicates whether 2 or more peaks were found along the transcript. </p>
general	pydeg_description	"<p> <code>PyDegradome</code> is a python script developed by <a href=""#citeproc_bib_item_2"">Gaglia, Rycroft, and Glaunsinger 2015</a> for the study of mRNA targets of a viral endonuclease on human cells. In broad terms, the script compares two samples, one having the factor thought to be involved in the production of mRNA degradation fragments (<i>test</i>) and another devoided of such factor (<i>control</i>); from this comparison it produces a table with genomic coordinates (<i>peaks</i>) where significant differences in the accumulation of degradation intermediates was found in test samples relative to their control. The threshold of significance is calculated using test:control ratio of reads along the exon multiplied by a user defined <i>multiplication factor</i> and evaluated under a <i>confidence interval</i> also defined by the user. </p>  <p> The results of the <a href=""https://github.com/mgaglia81/PyDegradome"">script</a>, as it was distributed at the time <a href=""#citeproc_bib_item_2"">Gaglia, Rycroft, and Glaunsinger</a> work was published, requires some level of post processing by the user namely, at least the annotation of the genomic coordinates to the corresponding gene. The results presented in this report correspond to such modifications using as a </p>"
general	pydeg_settings	<p> Following the authors recommendations, different script's settings were tested namely, the combination of three different values for multiplicative factor (<b>MF</b>) and two values for the confidence interval (<b>CI</b>) </p>
general	postpydeg_description	"<p> Briefly, the post processing of <code>PyDegradome</code> results included: </p> <ul class=""org-ul""> <li>Annotation of peak regions to transcript regions (when available): 5'UTE, CDS, 3'UTR</li> <li>Identification of peak regions shared between replicates</li> <li>Two classification steps, along with a filtering step.</li> <li>Plotting of all the degradation intermediates found in each transcript (<i>Decay plots</i>)</li> <li>Alignment of sequences from the identified peak region with known miRNA species</li> </ul>  <p> The code for the analysis is available on <a href=""https://github.com/ssl-bio/Degradome-analysis"">GitHub</a> and a detailed description of the modifications can be found on a series of <a href=""https://ssl-blog.netlify.app/posts/degradome-analysis/"">blog posts</a>. </p>"
general	mirna_alignment	"<p> <code>PyDegradome</code> was developed to study the targets of a endonuclease yet, most of the work that uses mRNA degradation fragments is focused on the role of microRNA species (<i>miRNA</i>). Accordingly most of the software available aims to identify potential miRNA targets from the degradation fragments. In this context, sequences found around the identified peaks were aligned to known miRNA species. Two different approaches were tested, 1) the simplest one performed a <i>global pairwise-alignment</i> (implemented in biopython V. 1.75  (<a href=""#citeproc_bib_item_1"">Cock et al. 2009</a>) using a 22nt region centered around the peak whereas, the second one used a program that predicts the strength of the interaction between a miRNA and a putative target  (Mirmap <a href=""#citeproc_bib_item_4"">Vejnar and Zdobnov 2012</a>; in this case a longer sequence around peaks (40nt) was compared to known miRNAs. For both approaches, an alignment file for the corresponding species was downloaded from <a href=""http://www.biosequencing.cn/TarDB/download.html"">TarDB</a> (<a href=""#citeproc_bib_item_3"">Liu et al. 2021</a>) and used as input for the alignment programs. Alignment scores were obtained and their lowest values used as threshold for the selection of candidates. </p>  <p> Note that this was done with peaks that were classified in the highest of both categories (<i>i.e.</i> Category 1 and Category A). </p>"
general	peak_list	<p> The table below list all peaks sorted by the two classification criteria and the value of the ratio between the highest read found in the peak region (test samples, T) and the highest read found outside it (control samples, C). Transcripts with an associated decay plot are <span class=hl>highlighted</span>. Note that due to limits in the hosting storage only 50 plots per category combination (<i>e.g.</i> <code>3-A</code>) were produced except for the highest category (<code>1-A</code>) were 100 plots were obtained. </p><p> Transcripts whose peak (or nearby) sequence were aligned to a known miRNA species are  <span class=mirna_font>colored</span>. Similarly to the above case, only sequences corresponding to the highest category combination (<code>1-A</code>) were considered for the alignment. </p><p>Dropdown menus below can be used to filter the list of candidates.</p>
general	feature_type	"<h4>Feature type:</h4>   <p> Accumulation of degradation intermediates in different regions of the transcript may reflect an underlying biological process but it also may be influenced by the enrichment method. For example <a href=""#citeproc_bib_item_4"">Nagarajan et al. 2019</a> showed that degradation intermediates accumulate differently depending on whether it selected for poly-adenylated or de-adenylated species. Selection for de-adenylated species tend to show higher accumulation in the 5'UTR region however, most of the degradome methods select for poly-adenylated species. </p>"
general	comparison	<h4>Sample comparison:</h4>   <p> Regions with significant differences in the accumulation of mRNA degradation intermediates are found only in the sample treated as <i>test</i> relative to that treated as a <i>control</i>. These correspond to the first and second samples indicated when running the <code>PyDegradome</code>. In this context the order of the samples compared would indicate in which sample does the significant regions were found. </p>
Zhang-2021	test_case_description	"<p> <a href=""#citeproc_bib_item_5"">Zhang et al. 2021</a> studied microRNAs (miRNAs) potentially involved in the regulation of organ size, more specifically miRNAs that influence cell wall development. To this end a list of 23 miRNA that are likely to target genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis were identified. Among these the authors focused on targets of miRNA775 due to its specificity to <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Over-expression of miR775 resulted in larger organ size whereas, <i>miRNA775</i> mutants had smaller organs and overall smaller plant height. Moreover, over-expression of a potential target of miR775, GALT9, resulted in smaller organ size whereas, <i>galt9</i> mutants showed the opposite phenotype.  The connection between miR775 and GALT9 was further supported by the use of a mutant version of GALT9 (GALT9m) where the residues that are likely to be targeted by miR775 were modified; in this system GALT9m accumulation was unaffected by miR775. Finally, the authors establish a connection between the transcription factor, HY5 (AT5G11260) and miRNA775-GALT9 where the former repressed the expression of the miRNA775 precursor thus, promoting the expression of GALT9. Based on measurements of pectin, galacturonic acid and mechanical properties of different mutants the authors propose a model where cell wall stiffness is regulated by the HY5-miRNA775-GALT9 pathway. </p>"
